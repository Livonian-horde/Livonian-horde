I am  a Ph.D. Student at ITMO University ðŸŽ“, advised by Prof. Sergey Kolyubin.

I've got MSc degree at Bauman University and now work as a Design engineer at Applied Robotics :wrench:

Yes, not a programmixer and\or datasatanist (That's what they're called, right?)

I am here to learn, let's see, where it can take me...
